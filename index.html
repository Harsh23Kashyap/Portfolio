          <p>
            I am a highly skilled and motivated Software Engineer with a strong background in Computer Science. I completed my education at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I graduated with a remarkable CGPA of 9.71. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a comprehensive understanding of software development principles, which I have further refined through my professional experiences with renowned companies such as Apple, Paypal, Licious, Cisco, Tata 1mg, and Yash Technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of my professional life, I have a variety of interests. I enjoy playing cricket, watching F1 races, going on treks, and working out at the gym. Additionally, I have actively participated in extracurricular activities during my college days, serving as the Vice Lead Ambassador of TICC and taking on the role of Placement Coordinator. These experiences have further enhanced my leadership and organizational abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a Software Engineer, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of technology.

                    Harsh worked with me as an intern for 2 months. He came fresh from college and was given a pretty technical, networking domain specific data science project as his goal. What he achieved in those two months was much more than what I had expected. 

                    <br>We gave him the basics of the domain, some papers on what we wanted to achieve and unleashed him on our data. He was self motivated and inquisitive and figured out most of the stuff on his own. He was able to analyse our dataset and recommend what algorithms and datapoints made sense and what we should be able to use to model our models. I found him proficient in python and data science related technologies. He is very dedicated and has the tenacity to stick through the phase when things are not working and the data did give him many such issues.

                    <br>I am very happy with his work and even though our association was not very long his work will influence our design and products for some time. I wish him the very best in his future endeavours.

                    Harsh is one of the most energetic, fast-learning, and focused intern I worked with. His work during the internship with Licious is commendable. He carries a great attitude. His dedication to his work is exemplary.

                    Harsh has been a valuable asset to The Thapar Institute Counselling Cell and I am sure he will add value to any organisation he becomes a part of. As a team vice lead, he was organised as well as helpful and was always open to new ideas and suggestions. I would recommend him for his managerial skills, dedication and good humour.
